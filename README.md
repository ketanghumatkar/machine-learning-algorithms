## Business Statement: 
Classify the fruite based mass, height, width, color_score  and predict the best accurancy using classification ML algorithms

## Problem:
Classify the fruite based mass, height, width, color_score

## Algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression:
   Accuracy: 0.40
   
2. Decision Tree:
   Accuracy: 0.73

3. KNN wiht k=5

## Verdict: 
For the supplied data, KNN with k=5 has hightest accurancy, so will follow that algorithm.
